#PonyUpZ-jQuery#

This is a fork of PonyUpz meant to use jQuery rather than Prototype.

It is a slow work in progress, but it will be complete.

As of now, Prototype-based scripts are not functional on Lunachan,
because we removed Prototype and Scriptaculous in favor of jQuery.


#This port is paused until I have free time!#
##I am switching sides, and the PonyUpZ portion will be converted to Prototype for the sake of simplicity.##
